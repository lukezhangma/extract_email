Validity: Microservice That Transforms Email Message 
==========================================================================

This project contains two directories, such as:
`k8s`,`web`

`k8s` contains ansible scripts that are used for deploying service on AWS EKS service. Unfortuately, I never have time to configure 'minikube' on my computer.
`web` contains a Django Web project which can be dockerized to run on your local desktop or on cloud.


Installation:
-------------
First decompress the gzip file:
```sh
$ tar -xzvf  validity.tar.gz
```

Secondly, go into `web` directory, build docker image, I assume you already have `docker` installed:
```sh
1. You could start web server from `web/validity` directory by running(assuming Python and Django are installed):
2. python ./manage.py runserver
```

Or dockerize the web service by:
```sh
1. $ docker build -t validity .
2. You could run the image on your local machine by:
3. $ docker run --name email -p 8000:8000 -d validity
```

Or go to `k8s` directory, run playbook to deploy it on AWS EKS,
we assume you have build docker image and push it to ECR service:
```sh
1. $ ansible-playbook deploy-email-service.yml
```

Explanation of Each File
---------------------------

Files in web service directoiry are mostly generated by using Django commands.
I won't go into details to set up the web service, you could read Django document for details.
I will explain the files that written by me:
```ini
[web/Dockerfile]
For building docker image of web service.
```

```ini
[web/requirements.txt]
Contains required software dor web service to be installed in container.
```

```ini

```


Next I will explain file for deploying to  `AWS EKS`:

```ini

```

```ini
[k8s/roles/initialization/defaults/main.yml]

```

```ini
[k8s/roles/deploy-service/template/emailservice.ym.j2]
The specification and definition of deployment of pod of email container service. 
```

Test of Web Services
